**Description of the Goal for January**  
The goal for January is to help players understand how to calculate their income, manage withholding allowances, and make informed financial decisions regarding taxes. Participants will choose a job, complete a W-4 form, and calculate gross and net pay. This introduces the fundamental concept of how income taxes and deductions affect take-home pay, which sets the stage for budgeting and financial planning.  
**Math/Economic Concepts for January**

	1\.	**Gross and Net Pay Calculation**

	•	Gross Pay \= Hours Worked × Pay Rate

	•	Net Pay \= Gross Pay \- Deductions

	2\.	**Understanding Deductions and Taxes**

	•	Social Security Tax (S.S.) \= Gross Pay × 3.8%

	•	Income Tax \= Gross Pay × Income Tax Rate (determined by allowances on the W-4 form).

	3\.	**Concept of Withholding Allowances**

	•	Claiming allowances adjusts how much is withheld from paychecks for income taxes. More allowances mean less tax is withheld, but it may result in owing taxes at the end of the year.
